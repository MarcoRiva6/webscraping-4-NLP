We ordered the mixed charcuterie that should have had an assortment of cheeses and meats, as well as the rigatoni chicken and mushroom.

The charcuterie only had one type of cheese - parmesan. The chicken in the pasta was dry. The service was okay. The water glasses were not clean and the bathroom soap didn’t work.

To top it off, a mouse ran across my foot. Would not recommend!

I honestly felt very uncomfortable at the whole experience. I couldn’t believe the price for the food that was set down infront of me. I put in that it was a special occasion for me and my boyfriend , did I recieve anything special NO. Absolutely don’t go here if you are thinking it’s going to be an experience. Yes the decor is nice but everything else is absolutely not. Will not be back and tik tok has a lot to blame for, overrated dishes that could of been better going to apache and Nandos.

Given the quality of the food, the restaurant’s prices are outrageously high. The service was terrible and extremely slow. Main course arrived late and cold !!!Additionally, the restaurant was  booked for a large event, and we were seated in the basement, which was the biggest letdown. If the restaurant is fully booked for an event, they shouldn’t accept outside reservations and then place guests in the basement. I strongly recommend confirming if there’s an event when making a reservation, as sitting in the basement was unpleasant.
